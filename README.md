# Simple React Chrome Extension Starter


### Why?

The Yeoman [generator-chrome-extension](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension) is simple and great! If you don't need React I definitely recommend it.

That being said I wanted to use React, I found many boilerplate but they were either too complex( lot of extra stuff ), had too many redundancies in the build process ( building popup, background, etc.. as separate apps) or a non-intuitive file structure. 
So after a 3 days of frustration I decided to just make a simple boilerplate :)

### How does it works?

This Repo is simply an ejected [CRA](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with the slightly modified Yeoman generated chrome extension inside the *public* and some glue in between.

#### -> Production

The production build process is fairly straight forward and pretty much works out of the box - the **build** folder is then loaded as an Unpacked Extension in Chrome
Run `Yarn build`

#### -> Development

In Dev mode, the chrome extension will be loading file from the **Webpack-dev-server** at localhost:3000 - If you see nothing displayed that would most likely be because of the server isn't running.
Load the **public** folder as an unpacked Extension

Please manually reload the app if you modify one of the **manisfest.json** 

#### -> Packaging

 ```javascript
yarn build
yarn keygen  // create the key.pem file
yarn compress  // compress for production (output both .zip and .crx)
yarn compress  --addversion //compress with version in name
```
>> Note I believe the release folder should not be tracked via git because the zip and crx contain your generated key.pem

<hr/>

## personal notes on how i made this 
- create regular react app
- eject app
- install copy-webpack-plugin' from npm 

- add an app & a background entry to the webpack.config files
- add the copywebpackplugin at the end of list of plugins

```
new CopyWebpackPlugin([
      { from: 'public/static' }
    ]),
```


- update the public/manifest.json file
    - watchout for where you put icons - static/media/

- create your Yeoman Chrome extension inside /public/temp

- create 2 folders : options and popup
- clone the content of the CRA public/index.html in 2 new files in the public folders: options.html, popup.html
  - the injected bundle file for each will be manually added here - we could mess with the webpack.configs some more but for simplicity sake we wont
  


- configure eslint to not crash when encountering *chrome* references in our code - add this to package.json 
```
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app",
    "env": {
      "node": true,
      "browser": true
    },
    "globals": {
      "chrome": true
    },
    "rules": {
      "eol-last": 0,
      "quotes": [
        2,
        "single"
      ]
    }
  } 
  ```


```registerServiceWorker.js``` is to be use solely during development, see CRA page


```/**
 * This chrome Extension is setup with 2 entry points 
 * the FrontEnd  in src/popup/index.js
 * and the BackEnd in src/backgound/index.js
 */
 ```
 .babelrc seems to get overriden when running yarn ... not sure why... i didn't mofified anything in regard to babel except adding the runtime plugin. I blame the ejected CRA for that :P  
```

{
  "presets": [
    "env",
    "react",
    "stage-0"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "transform-class-properties",
    "transform-decorators",
    "transform-react-constant-elements",
    "transform-react-inline-elements",
    "transform-runtime"
  ]
}
```

### Contentscript not updating??

In dev mode, when **contentscript** is update - the entire chrome app needs to be reloaded or the old version would still be used. I believe it's because the dev mode Manifest.json is referencing contentscript.bundle.js directly and <s>once loaded chrome will cache this</s> anything inside **public/** is considered static and is loaded only once.
The quick dirty solution is to add the script tab bellow to background.html... however this would run the contentscript code at the same scope as the background app... that's a **HUGE security issue plz don't do this!**
``` html

<script src="http://localhost:3000/contentscript.bundle.js"></script>

```

A solutions:
  -  inject it within the iframe, but it looked very ugly to me.
  - chrome.runtime.reload() ... this needs further investigation to avoid reload loops in dev mode...
  - use web_accessible_resources and change ["contentscript.bundle.js"] in manifest.json to some kind of contentScriptDevInjector.js script (to be placed under public/) that would inject an html web ressource into the page... crap this is the ifram biz again hmm.. oh well.. will try that later - so in theory each time the app is open.. it should pull the web_ressource and therefore get the latest content script. This would be a dev hack and shouldn't go in the production manifest
```javascript
// in manifest.json 
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches":["http://localhost:3000/*"],
    "js":["contentScriptDevInjector.js"]
  }
],

"web_accessible_resources": [
    ...,
    "contentscript.html",
],

//contentscript.html - not sure yet if contentscript.bundle.js would be available like this but i think this shoudl work...
<script src="http://localhost:3000/contentscript.bundle.js"></script>


// contentScriptDevInjector.js
var iframe  = document.createElement ('iframe');
iframe.src  = chrome.extension.getURL ('contentscript.html');
document.body.appendChild (iframe);

```
Anyway long story short for now when anything under contentscript/ is modified the app needs to be manually reloaded in chrome via the extension manager page.
